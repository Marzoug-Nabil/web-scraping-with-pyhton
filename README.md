## Introduction
This project aims to scrape data from Z Library, a popular online library that provides access to a vast collection of free eBooks and academic articles. By using Beautiful Soup, a Python library for web scraping, we can extract useful information from the website and store it for further analysis or personal use.

## Project Overview
Web scraping allows us to automate the process of gathering data from websites, saving time and effort in manually collecting information. This project specifically focuses on scraping book information from Z Library, such as book titles, authors, publication dates, genres, and download links.

## Prerequisites
To run this project successfully, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-z-library.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd web-scraping-z-library`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests` (you can use a virtual environment if desired)

## Usage
1. Run the main script to initiate the web scraping process: `python main.py`
2. The script will start scraping data from Z Library based on the provided configurations.
3. The scraped data will be saved in a structured format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database (based on your implementation).

## Libraries Used
- Beautiful Soup 4: Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
- Requests: Python library for making HTTP requests.
